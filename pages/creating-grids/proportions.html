  <p>The most flexible grid – giving us the most possibilities for layout – would be a column for every pixel right? How useless would that be? Flexibility is not solely what we seek in a grid system. We want a harmonious and meaningful utilization of space to house our content. This includes proportions between elements, as well as the proportions of negative space. Columns are a crutch. Less columns means less options for layout, reinforcing structure, creating a stronger content hierarchy, and therefore improving the overall clarity of communication.</p>
