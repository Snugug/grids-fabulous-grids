notes: >
  * When choosing the content areas, there is a balance that needs to be made between flexibility and constraints
    * A symmetric grid, where each content area is the same size offers greater flexibility but fewer constraints
    * An asymmetric grid, where content areas are of different sizes, offer greater constraints with less flexibility

  * Constraints are good!
    * Simpler grids with less possible variations lead to cleaner hierarchies for content
    * Too many options leads to over-thinking layouts! The goal of a grid system is to minimize the thought processes to keep your mind free to find more creative opportunities for expression
    * Using asymmetrical, uneven content areas, much like the rule of thirds, allows for more dynamic, engaging layouts that fir the needs of your imagery, text, or whatever else
    * Less options also means less to adjust for responsive design, allowing hierarchy and compositions to scale more fluidly
