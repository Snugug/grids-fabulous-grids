  * Asymmetry became a guiding principle to feel more natural
    * Introduction of left-aligned text
    * Asymmetry, like the rule of thirds in photography, makes content feel more dynamic and engaging

  * Grids became entrenched in Graphic Design, even if they aren't always straight-forward
    * Famous posters by Josef Muller Brockmann (left), Richard P. Lohse, Armin Hofmann and Alberto Longhi (right)
