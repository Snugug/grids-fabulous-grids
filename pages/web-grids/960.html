state: 960
notes: >
  * First release was March of 2008

  * 960gs comes with 2 column layouts: 12 and 16 column, and does not have a vertical column, with 12 being the most widely used

  * The premise was originally for rapid prototyping, although it does say that it would work equally well for production

  * Markup relied heavily on nesting of divs, with creator Nathan Smith taking a strong stance that semantics were not in class names or div nesting, but in the actual tags used and content in the tags
    * He's right there, but it also led to lots of messy, hard-to-follow markup

  * It was a big hit because it included not only CSS, but templates in all of the major graphic editors at the time

  * â€¦Then, on May 25, 2010, Ethan Marcotte released his A List Apart article "Responsive Web Design" and static grids had to be rethought
