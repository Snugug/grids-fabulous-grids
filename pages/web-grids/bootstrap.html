  * In August and September of 2011, Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation had their first respective releases

  * Both came with a 12 column 960-based grid that replicated its functionality (both in markup and class structure).

  * All of these grids were based on `float` layout models. In 2012, though, we got a new layout model to work with; flexbox.
    * This is the "tweener" syntax, the first implementation of the final syntax, unprefixed, would show up in 2013
