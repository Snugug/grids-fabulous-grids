<p>In September of 2006, Cameron Moll discussed creating the <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/001220.html">optimal website width for a 1024px resolution screen</a>.</p>
<p class="fragment">In it, he discusses the need to move from <code>800x600</code> resolution to <code>1024x768</code></p>
<p class="fragment">In it, he proposes using <code>960px</code> as the full-width of a site as "it’s slightly smaller than full width, and it’s divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 16"</p>
